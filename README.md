Utilized Kotlin Coroutine and implemented the MVVM design pattern to:

Call API endpoints provided using the CRUD platform.
Stored retrieved data locally using Room Database.
Enabled editing of data locally, ensuring that the updated values are reflected when the app is reopened.
Integrated Google Maps functionality to display the current latitude and longitude.

For API integration, I created endpoints with parameters including Name, Email, Mobile, and Gender. Additionally, I adhered to the following steps:

Initially saved data to the database using the CRUDplatform.
Implemented GET method to list the stored data.
Called the API endpoints and stored the retrieved data locally, fulfilling the specified tasks.
